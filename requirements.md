**5\. Blockchain-Specific Requirements (StarkNet & Cairo)**

- **NFT Event Passes:**
  - Event passes shall be implemented as NFTs on StarkNet using Cairo smart
    contracts.
  - NFT metadata (event name, date, pass image URI, link to event details) shall
    be stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS), with the URI stored in the Cairo contract.
  - The platform shall manage the minting process.
  - The system must allow for configuration of NFT transferability
    (non-transferable or admin-controlled).
  - The system should implement access control mechanisms to manage event pass
    transfers.

- **On-Chain Milestone Payments for Vendors:**
  - Vendor payments for milestones shall be facilitated using stablecoins (e.g.,
    USDC, DAI) on StarkNet.
  - Cairo smart contracts shall be used to implement escrow mechanisms for
    milestone payments.
  - Escrow contracts shall lock funds, with release conditioned on planner
    approval or arbitrator decision.
  - Multi-signature logic (e.g., Planner, Vendor, Platform Arbitrator) may be
    implemented within Cairo contracts for fund release.
  - Smart contracts must manage the state of each milestone (Pending, Completed,
    Disputed, Paid).

- **Dispute Resolution (On-Chain Component):**
  - An impartial arbitrator role shall be defined, potentially with authority
    within the smart contract to resolve disputes and trigger fund release.
  - A secure mechanism for relaying off-chain arbitrator decisions to the Cairo
    smart contract is required (e.g., verifiable oracle solutions).

- **Wallet Management:**
  - The platform must decide on a custodial vs. non-custodial wallet strategy
    for users. A non-custodial approach is generally preferred for user-held
    assets like NFTs and vendor payouts.
  - If non-custodial, the platform must provide guidance or integrate with
    user-friendly StarkNet wallets (e.g., Argent X, Braavos).
  - Platform-owned wallets (for minting, escrow deployment) must be highly
    secure.

- **On-Ramp/Off-Ramp Solutions:**
  - The platform must facilitate or guide users to on-ramp/off-ramp solutions
    for converting stablecoins on StarkNet to/from fiat currencies.
  - Integration with established Layer 2 bridges and fiat on-ramps is required.

- **Transaction Monitoring:**
  - The platform backend shall monitor the StarkNet for transaction
    confirmations related to payments and NFT minting/transfers.
  - Transaction indexing and status tracking must account for StarkNet's proof
    generation time.

- **Smart Contract Security:**
  - All custom Cairo smart contracts must undergo thorough security audits.
  - Mitigation strategies for common vulnerabilities (access control flaws,
    reentrancy, etc.) must be implemented.
  - Formal verification of critical contract components should be considered.
  - Secure upgradeability mechanisms for Cairo contracts must be planned.
  - StarkNet-specific security considerations must be addressed.

**6\. AI Integration Requirements**

- **AI for Automated Task Generation:**
  - The system shall use AI (e.g., LLMs via API like OpenAI) to generate a
    comprehensive task list for event planners based on event type, budget,
    guest count, duration, etc.
  - Prompt engineering best practices shall be followed to ensure relevant and
    structured output (e.g., JSON format).
  - LangChain or similar frameworks may be used for structured output.

- **AI for Cost Estimation:**
  - The system shall use AI/ML models to assist planners in generating initial
    budget estimates.
  - This may start with rule-based/parametric models and evolve to ML models
    trained on platform data as it accumulates.
  - AI-generated estimates should be presented as suggestions, with planners
    retaining override capability.

- **AI for Vendor Matching and Recommendation:**
  - The system shall use AI to recommend suitable vendors to event planners.
  - Algorithms may include content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or
    hybrid models.
  - Vendor profiles and event requirements will be key data inputs.
  - Strategies to address the cold-start problem for new planners and vendors
    are needed.
  - Explainability for recommendations should be considered to build user trust.
  - Potential for bias in AI recommendations must be monitored and mitigated.

**7\. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Hono framework, TypeScript.
  - **Database:** MongoDB.
  - **Mobile Application:** React Native.
  - **Blockchain:** StarkNet (Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum).
  - **Smart Contracts:** Cairo language.
  - **Caching:** Redis (for performance and real-time feature support like chat
    Pub/Sub).
  - **File Storage:**
    - General application files (images, documents): Centralized cloud storage
      (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    - NFT Metadata & Assets: Decentralized storage (IPFS) with pinning services.

- **Performance & Scalability:**
  - The system must handle peak loads during popular events or simultaneous
    bookings.
  - Backend services shall be designed for horizontal scalability.
  - Database optimization (indexing, read replicas, potential sharding for
    MongoDB) is required.
  - Efficient list rendering and navigation in the React Native app.
  - Optimized image handling (formats, resizing, caching).
  - Use of Hermes JavaScript engine for React Native.
  - API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

- **Security:**
  - **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure JWT implementation, OAuth 2.0,
    RBAC for multi-role access.
  - **Data Privacy (PII Handling):**
    - Encryption of PII at rest (MongoDB) and in transit (TLS/SSL, WSS).
    - Data minimization principles.
    - Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, especially concerning blockchain's
      immutability (no PII on-chain).
  - **Payment Processing Security:**
    - PCI DSS compliance for fiat payments (achieved by integrating with
      compliant third-party gateways like Stripe).
    - AML/KYC considerations for crypto payments, potentially leveraging
      third-party KYC providers or integrated ramp services.
  - **Blockchain Security:**
    - Secure wallet management
    - Cairo smart contract security audits
    - Vulnerability mitigation

    details).
  - Consider read-only offline access for planners/vendors initially, with
    queued actions for online sync.
  - Use appropriate local storage (e.g., WatermelonDB, Realm, secure storage for
    sensitive items).
  - Implement data synchronization and conflict resolution strategies.
- **Real-time Communication:**
  - Low-latency chat and notifications.
  - Scalable WebSocket infrastructure (e.g., Socket.IO with Redis Pub/Sub for
    horizontal scaling).
